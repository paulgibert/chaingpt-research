The 'kind' project comprises Go packages implementing cluster creation, image build, and a command-line interface. It builds with 'make' and can install directly from the repository. On systems without Go, 'kind' can be built with Docker using 'make build'. The project supports multi-node clusters and builds Kubernetes release builds from source.
