1. Target: AUTOMAKE_OPTIONS
   Description: This target sets the options for automake. The 'foreign' option is used to relax some of the GNU standards, allowing for a more portable Makefile.

2. Target: ACLOCAL_AMFLAGS
   Description: This target sets the flags for aclocal, a tool that generates an 'aclocal.m4' file based on the contents of 'configure.ac'. Here, it's set to look in the 'm4' directory.

3. Target: AM_CFLAGS
   Description: This target sets the flags for the C compiler. The '-Werror' and '-Wall' options enable all warning messages and treat them as errors.

4. Target: lib_LTLIBRARIES
   Description: This target specifies the libraries to be built by libtool. In this case, it's 'libguac-client-vnc.la'.

5. Target: libguac_client_vnc_la_SOURCES
   Description: This target specifies the source files for the 'libguac-client-vnc.la' library. Here, it's 'src/vnc_client.c'.

Generate minimalist and straightforward instructions for compiling and
installing the source code of the software project guac,
version 0.3.0. The GitHub repository is https://github.com/apache/guacamole-server. Checkout 0.3.0 for the correct version.
The instructions should be concise and solely focused on the build and installation process,
excluding any steps related to testing, linting, or other unrelated tasks.
If multiple build methods are available, choose the most direct and
uncomplicated method and provide a consistent set of steps without
mixing different approaches. You will respond in JSON form only.

The response should contain the following fields:

summary: A description of the components the project uses and how they are built. If able, provide
         step-by-step build instructions.

description: A single sentence description of the project. It should not start with the project's name.

license: The license under which the project is released. Include the license name only.

steps: An ordered list of build commands.
       Each build step is an object with specific fields depending on its type.
       There are different step types, each requiring unique fields. If using
       a place holder value or reporting any value that is not meant to be
       interpreted literally, surround the value with  "<< >>" e.g <<place holder>>.
       Assume you have root privileges on the system (no need to use sudo).

Step type: git-checkout - Clone a git repository and checkout a branch/tag
Fields:
'repository' (required) - Repository to clone. Omit the .git suffix
'tag' (optional) - Branch or tag to checkout. Must specify either a branch or tag.
'branch' (optional) - Branch to checkout. Do not specify both a branch and tag

Step type: shell - Run a shell command. Use as a last resort when desired functionality cannot be captured by another build step type.
Fields:
'command' (required) - Command to run

Step type: go/build - Builds a project with `go build` and installs it to <prefix>/<install_dir>/<output>
Fields:
'packages' (required) - A single string of space-separated packages to compile. Files can also be specified. This is the value passed to `go build`. Paths are relative to modroot.
'output' (required) - Name of the output binary. The final install location will be in <prefix>/<install_dir>/<output>
'modroot' (optional) - Top directory of the go module, this is where `go.mod` lives. Before building the go pipeline will `cd` into this directory.
'prefix' (optional) - Prefix to install binaries. Defaults to 'usr'.
'ldflags' (optional) - A single string of space-separated flags ([pattern=]arg) to pass to the `-ldflags` arg of `go build`.
'install_dir' (optional) - Binaries are installed in this directory <prefix>/<install_dir>. Defaults to 'bin'.
