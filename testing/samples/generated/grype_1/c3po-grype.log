1. build: This target builds snapshot release binaries and packages. It's essential for creating the executable versions of the software.

2. release: This target triggers the release process. It's crucial for the distribution of the software.

3. ci-release: This target checks the continuous integration and cleans the distribution before releasing the software. It's important for ensuring the software is ready for release.

4. clean: This target removes previous builds, result reports, and test cache. It's essential for maintaining a clean workspace and ensuring accurate builds and tests.

5. ci-check: This target runs a script to check the continuous integration. It's important for ensuring the software is ready for release.

INFO:root:Using assistant prompt:

Generate minimalist and straightforward instructions for compiling and
installing the source code of the software project grype,
version 0.72.0. The GitHub repository is https://github.com/anchore/grype. Checkout v0.72.0 for the correct version.
The instructions should be concise and solely focused on the build and installation process,
excluding any steps related to testing, linting, or other unrelated tasks.
If multiple build methods are available, choose the most direct and
uncomplicated method and provide a consistent set of steps without
mixing different approaches. You will respond in JSON form only.

The response should contain the following fields:

summary: A description of the components the project uses and how they are built. If able, provide
         step-by-step build instructions.

description: A single sentence description of the project. It should not start with the project's name.

license: The license under which the project is released. Include the license name only.

steps: An ordered list of build commands.
       Each build step is an object with specific fields depending on its type.
       There are different step types, each requiring unique fields. If using
       a place holder value or reporting any value that is not meant to be
       interpreted literally, surround the value with  "<< >>" e.g <<place holder>>.
       Assume you have root privileges on the system (no need to use sudo).

Step type: git-checkout - Clone a git repository and checkout a branch/tag
Fields:
'repository' (required) - Repository to clone. Omit the .git suffix
'tag' (optional) - Branch or tag to checkout. Must specify either a branch or tag.
'branch' (optional) - Branch to checkout. Do not specify both a branch and tag

Step type: shell - Run a shell command. Use as a last resort when desired functionality cannot be captured by another build step type.
Fields:
'command' (required) - Command to run

Step type: go/build - Builds a project with `go build` and installs it to <prefix>/<install_dir>/<output>
Fields:
'packages' (required) - A single string of space-separated packages to compile. Files can also be specified. This is the value passed to `go build`. Paths are relative to modroot.
'output' (required) - Name of the output binary. The final install location will be in <prefix>/<install_dir>/<output>
'modroot' (optional) - Top directory of the go module, this is where `go.mod` lives. Before building the go pipeline will `cd` into this directory.
'prefix' (optional) - Prefix to install binaries. Defaults to 'usr'.
'ldflags' (optional) - A single string of space-separated flags ([pattern=]arg) to pass to the `-ldflags` arg of `go build`.
'install_dir' (optional) - Binaries are installed in this directory <prefix>/<install_dir>. Defaults to 'bin'.
